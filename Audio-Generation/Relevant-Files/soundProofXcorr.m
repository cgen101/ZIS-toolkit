% SOUNDPROOFXCORR Implementaition of the SoundProof correlation engine by
% Karapanos, Nikolaos, et al. 
% "Sound-Proof: Usable Two-Factor Authentication Based on Ambient Sound."
% USENIX Security Symposium. 2015.

%   Input args:
%   - S1 - First audio signal (Nx1 vector)
%   - S2 - Second audio signal (Nx1 vector)
%   - sampleDiff - Delay between two signals in samples (integer)
%   - Fs - Sampling frequency in Hz (integer)
%   - spfFilterBank - Filter bank (cell of size 20x1, each cell contains
% a digitalFilter object)

%   Output args:
%   - maxXCorr - Avgerage maximum cross-corellation over 20 octave bands
%   - xcorrFreqBands - Max correlation in each octave band (hashmap)
